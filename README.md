## 🖨️ WeasyPrint System Dependencies (Windows)

WeasyPrint requires GTK3 runtime on Windows.

### 1. Install GTK3 Runtime

Download and install:
https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer

Default install path:
```
C:\Program Files\GTK3-Runtime Win64\bin
```

### 2. Set Environment Variable

You must set `WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES` so WeasyPrint can locate GTK DLL files.

#### Windows CMD

set WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES=C:\Program Files\GTK3-Runtime Win64\bin
```

#### PowerShell

```powershell
$Env:WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES="C:\Program Files\GTK3-Runtime Win64\bin"

⚠️ This environment variable must be set **before running the script**.
